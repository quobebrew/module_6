# Proptech Analysis in San Francisco

Proptech, the integration of technology into the real estate market, represents an innovative domain within the fintech industry. In this project, we'll assume the role of an analyst at a proptech company aiming to revolutionize the real estate market in San Francisco. Our company aims to provide an instant, one-click service for individuals to purchase properties and then rent them out. By conducting a trial of this service in the San Francisco real estate market, we aim to gauge its popularity and potential for expansion into other markets.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage data visualization techniques, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to identify viable investment opportunities in the San Francisco housing market.

### Data Exploration and Analysis

#### Housing Units Per Year

We start by examining the trend in housing units over the years. Using numerical and visual aggregation techniques, we calculate the number of housing units per year and visualize the results as a bar chart. This analysis provides insights into the overall trend in housing unit availability over the period under analysis.

#### Average Sale Prices per Square Foot

Next, we delve into the average sale prices per square foot over time. By grouping the data by year and averaging the results, we analyze the trends in sale prices and identify any significant fluctuations. Additionally, we explore the relationship between sale prices and gross rent to uncover insights into market dynamics.

#### Comparison of Sale Prices by Neighborhood

We further analyze the average sale prices per square foot by neighborhood. Using interactive visualizations, we compare sale prices and gross rent across different neighborhoods in San Francisco. This analysis helps identify neighborhoods with promising investment potential and highlights variations in market conditions across the city.

#### Interactive Neighborhood Map

Finally, we leverage geospatial analysis to visualize the distribution of average sale prices and gross rent across San Francisco neighborhoods. By creating an interactive map, we identify neighborhoods with the highest gross rent and sale prices per square foot, offering valuable insights for investment decisions.

## Conclusion

Through comprehensive data analysis and visualization, we have gained valuable insights into the San Francisco housing market. Our findings highlight trends in rental income growth compared to sales prices and identify neighborhoods with attractive investment opportunities. Armed with this information, our proptech company is well-equipped to pursue its one-click, buy-and-rent strategy in the San Francisco market and beyond.
